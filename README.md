# Forest-Fire-Prediction
## Introduction:
Forest or Wildlife fires are uncontrolled fires in area of combustible vegetation. Depending on the scale of fire it can be classified as bush fires, forest fires, etc. They pose a huge risk to wildlife and it becomes pertinent that we come up with a solution to counter it .Now the main challenge that comes up here is to detect or predict a wildfire before it actually happens because once a forest fire gets started it becomes very difficult to put them out before they cause large scale irreversible damage. Machine learning is learning from data to be able to predict the future.Hence, we are going to model some parameters crucial for any forest fire to take place and predict the possibility of a forest fire taking place based on that.

## Principle of Wildfire detection:
The detection of a wildfire is primarily dependent upon 3 factors
1. Oxygen Level: For any fire take place, high oxygen content is required. So higher the oxygen more is the probability of a wildfire taking place
2. Temperature: Obviously for a fire to take place, heat is favourable. Hence high temperature increases the probability of fire in any region.
3. Humidity: Obviously Humid weather is unfavourable for a fire, whereas a dry weather is. Therefore, higher the humidity, lower the probability of a fire taking place.
